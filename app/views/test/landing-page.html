      <p>You can use it to make the best child maintenance arrangement for your circumstances.</p>


<p>You'll be able to:

</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>find out what child maintenance is
</li>
    <li>calculate the amount of child maintenance you might pay or receive
</li>
    <li>download and print forms that could help you and the other parent make your own arrangement
</li>
    <li>find out how the child maintenance service can help
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Tell us what you think</h2>
<p>When you've finished, you'll be able to take part in an optional survey that will help us to make this website better. It should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</p>
