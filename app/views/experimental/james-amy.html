        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">James and Amy's shared care arrangement</h1>

        <p>James and Amy have 3 children. They separated 2 months ago but are still friends and can talk to each other about
            most things.
        </p>

        <p>James and Amy share care of the kids and have agreed to go halves on large expenses like uniforms and after school
            activities. They keep in touch by SMS during the week so they know what homework needs doing, or if any of the
            kids have parties or competitions coming up.
        </p>


        <p>Both of them give the kids the same amount of pocket money, and theyâ€™ve agreed to spend the same amounts on birthday
            and Christmas presents, to minimise arguments and stop the kids playing them against each other.
        </p>

        <p>This arrangement works well for them because they are able to communicate in a friendly way and they work hard to
            put the kids first at all times.</p>
