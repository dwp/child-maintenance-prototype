<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is an arrangement?</h2>

        <p>A child maintenance arrangement is financial support towards your child’s everyday living costs
             when you’ve separated from the other parent. You and the other parent can arrange child maintenance 
             yourself if you can agree.</p>
        
        <p>There are many ways of making an arrangement that are not financial, for example, 
            you could agree to share care of the child.</p>
        
        <p>There are also many ways of making an arrangement that are financial.</p>
        <p>For example, you could split the costs of specific items, or the non-resident parent could pay
             a proportion of their income to the parent with care.
        </p>
        <p>The non-resident parent could also pay:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>for things like housing costs, uniforms, clothes, school trips, or after school clubs</li>
            <li>larger lump sums at certain times in the child’s life</li>
        </ul>

    <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible"id="whattoinclude">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" >What to include in an arrangement</h2>
<p>Your arrangement can include whatever works for both parents.</p>
<p>You could agree to share care of your child, or school pick-up and drop-off responsibilities.</p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible"id="financial">
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" >Make a financial arrangement</h3>


<p>Many parents choose to make a financial arrangement. For example, the parent who does not live with the child might pay:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a fixed amount to the parent with care each month</li>
    <li>for specific items for the child, like uniforms, school trips, or after school activities</li>
    <li>for housing costs, like rent, mortgage payments, or household bills</li>
    <li>larger lump sums at certain times in the child&#146;s life</li>
</ul>

<p>If you both agree to a financial arrangement, you will also need to agree how and when payments will be made, and if you
    will review your arrangement in the future.</p>
<p> You can use the
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-child-maintenance" target="_blank">child maintenance calculator
    </a>(opens in new window or tab) to get an estimate of how much the Child Maintenance Service would calculate as a fair
    amount to pay.</p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible" id ="howtopay">
<h4 class="govuk-heading-m" >How to pay child maintenance</h4>

<p>There are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable will depend on the arrangement you have and your circumstances.</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Pay by standing order</h5>
<p>If you&#146;ve agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent directly
    from one person&#146;s bank or building society account to another person&#146;s account.</p>

<p>A standing order helps both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.</p>

<h6 class="govuk-heading-s">Use a money transfer service</h6>
<p>Another option is to use a money transfer service, like PayPal or MoneyGram. This method means you don’t have to share your
    bank details with the other parent.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
    <p>Some of these services may charge a fee. Check with the service provider to make sure you understand if any charges will
        apply.</p>
</div>


<h7 class="govuk-heading-s">Other ways to pay</h7>

<p>If you make your own arrangement, you can agree to change your payment method if your circumstances change.</p>
<p>For example, if the paying parent loses their job, both parents could agree to reduce the child maintenance payments until
    the paying parent is back in work.</p>

<p>Or, if the receiving parent needs to make urgent repairs to the home they live in with the children, the paying parent could
    help with the cost by paying a lump sum, instead of the regular payments.</p>

<p>There are many tools, guides and organisations that can help separated parents to reach an agreement for child maintenance.</p>

<p>This
    <a href="https://www.cmoptions.org/en/pdfs/refresh/family-based-arrangement-form-aug-2015.pdf" target="_blank">arrangement tool (opens in new window or tab)</a> has helped some parents to reach an agreement for child maintenance.</p>

<p>Having a friend or family member there when you speak to each other can help separated parents to focus on the thing they’re
    trying to agree. They will need to stay calm and neutral, so choose someone you both trust.</p>

    parent.</p>
<p>Some parents find it useful to write down what they have agreed, so they have something to refer to in future.</p>
