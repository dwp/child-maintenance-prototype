        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Charges for using collect and pay</h1>
<p>If you decide to use the Collect and Pay service you’ll have to pay fees for collecting and paying out child maintenance.</p>
<p>You’ll have to pay a fee each time you make or receive a payment:
</p>        

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>paying parents will pay a 20% fee on top of their regular child maintenance payment
</li>

<li>receiving parents will have a 4% fee deducted from their regular child maintenance payment
</li>

</ul>

<p>For example if the child maintenance service calculated the amount to be paid each month to be £50, the paying parent would pay £60 per month. The recieving parent would receive £48 per month.</p>
<p>Over 12 months you would pay £144 in fees for using Collect and Pay.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay any fees if you choose to <a href="fba">make your own arrangement</a>.
</p>

<p>You will not have to pay collection fees if you choose <a href="direct-pay">Direct Pay</a> where you make your own payment arrangements.</p>
