        <p>Laura and Kyle both had a lot of debt after the break-up of their relationship, so Laura didnâ€™t feel able to pay an amount
        of child maintenance to Kyle. </p> <p>Instead, they agreed that Laura would pick the kids up from school every day, as well as having
        them at weekends and during the school holidays.
