<p>You are eligible to apply to the Child Maintenance service.</p>
<p>There is a Â£20 application fee when you apply, unless you are under 19, a victim of domestic abuse or in Northern Ireland.

    to collect or enforce payments. </p>

        <p>You can still arrange child maintenance between yourselves, if you can agree. This is called a &#146;family-based arrangement&#8217;.</p>
        <p>There are no charges for making a family-based arrangement. Parents arrange everything themselves and no-one else has to
            be involved. It is flexible, and can be changed if either of your circumstances change.</p>
        <p>You agree how much the financial contributions should be and when they should be made.</p>
        <p>If you both agree to regular payments, you can
            <a href="calculator">get an estimate of how much payments should be</a>.</p>
<p>Find out <a href="">how to make an arrangement yourselves</a>.</p>
