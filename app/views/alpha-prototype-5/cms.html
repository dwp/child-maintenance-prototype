        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Applying to the Child Maintenance Service</h1>


<p>To apply you must:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>live in the UK</li>
    <li>be a parent or guardian of the child, or a child over 12 living in Scotland</li>
    <li>pay a Â£20 application fee, unless you or your child have experienced domestic abuse, under 19, or in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<p>The Child Maintenance Service will calculate a legally enforceable amount and tell both parents when it should be paid.
</p>
<p>Extra charges will apply if you need the Child Maintenance Service to collect and pass on payments between you, or if the
    service needs to enforce payments.
</p>
<p>(Case study to show extra charges over year? Table of additional charges?)
