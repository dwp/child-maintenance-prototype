<p>If you are able to contact the other parent and can have a conversation about child maintenance, 
    you can use the <a href=".">discussion guide</a> to arrange it yourselves.</p>



<p>This discussion guide contains steps to take that may help you to have a conversation with the other parent
 to make a new arrangement.</p>

<p>If you need someone to help you to reach an agreement, ask a friend or family member,
 or <a href=".">find a local mediator</a> to support you.</p>

<p>Many separated parents write down what they have agreed, so they have something to refer to. [could be a contract?]</p>

<p>If you want to make your agreement legally binding, you can ask a court to formalise it with a <a href=".">consent order
 or minute of agreement</a>. This means the agreement can be enforced through the courts if either parent
  doesnâ€™t do what has been agreed.</p>

  <p>If you have been unsucessful in arranging child maintenance yourself, you can contact 
      <a href=".">child maintenance</a></p>
