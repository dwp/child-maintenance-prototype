        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Making an arrangement</h1>

<p>Child maintenance is financial support towards your child’s everyday living costs when you’ve separated from the 
    other parent. You and your ex-partner can arrange child maintenance yourself if you can agree.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to pay</h2>
        <p>One option for making an arrangement is for the paying parent to pay the parent with care a monthly amount to provide
            for the child. You could use the
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-child-maintenance">child maintenance calculator</a> to find out how much might be a fair amount.</p>

        <p>An arrangement doesn't have to be a fixed payment amount. It could be an agreement that the paying parent could pay:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>for things like housing costs, uniforms, clothes, school trips, or after school clubs</li>
            <li>larger lump sums at certain times in the child’s life</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you choose to make your own financial arrangement, both parents will need to agree:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>how much will be paid and what is being paid for</li>
            <li>when they will be paid
                <li>how payments will be made </li>
                <li>You could also agree to review or change your arrangement in the future.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need help agreeing your arrangement</h3>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>ask a friend or family member, or
                <a href="https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/">find a local mediator</a> to support you.</li>
            <li>write down what you have agreed, so you have something to refer to.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps</h4>
         <p>Using the tools and information provided, you can now make your own child maintenance arrangement.

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            Making an arrangement between yourselves might not be appropriate if you think the other parent poses a threat to you or
            your child, or if you are a victim of domestic abuse. If you feel making an arrangement could make you vulnerable,
            <a href="phone">speak to one of our agents about your options</a>.</div>

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have tried your own arrangement and it has failed
        </h4>
        <p>If you have tried your own arrangement and it has failed, either parent can ask the Child Maintenance Service to
            make a new, formal arrangement.</p>
        <p>The Child Maintenance Service will calculate a legally enforceable amount and tell both parents when it should be
            paid.
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>There is a £20 application fee (unless you are under 19, a victim of domestic abuse or live in Northern Ireland.)</li>
            <li>Extra charges will apply if you need the Child Maintenance Service to collect and pass on payments between you,
                or if the service needs to enforce payments.</li>
        </ul>
