        <p>The Child Maintenance Service may be able to collect the amount from the paying parent and pass it to the receiving parent â€“ this is known as a 'Collect and Pay' arrangement. If this happens, you'll need to pay:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a 20% fee on top of your regular child maintenance payments, if you're the paying parent</li>
          <li>a 4% fee taken off your regular child maintenance payments, if you're the recieving parent.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To apply to the Child Maintenance Service you'll first need to contact Child Maintenance Options, who will
            help you to find the right arrangement.
