                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How and when to make payments</h2>

                <p>There are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable will depend on
                    your circumstances.</p>

                <p>If you’ve agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent directly from
                    one person’s bank or building society account to another person’s account.</p>

                <p>A standing order helps both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.</p>

                <p>How often you make payments is up to you to agree. For example it could be weekly, fortnightly or monthly.</p>
