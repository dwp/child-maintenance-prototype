<p>Use this calculator to work out child maintenance for your circumstances.
</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">The receiving parent has main day-to-day care of the child. The paying parent does not have main day-to-day care.
</div>


<p>The calculator uses the same rules as the Child Maintenance Service.
</p>
<p>You'll need to know:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>whether the paying parent gets any government benefits or State Pension</li>
          <li>the paying parent's total income, before tax is taken off</li>
            <li>if any other children live with the paying parent</li>
        </ul>


        <p>If the paying parent has child arrangements with more than one receiving parent a calculation should be done for the total
        number of children, and divided equally between them.</p>
