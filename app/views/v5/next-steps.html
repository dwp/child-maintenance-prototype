<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl" >How to pay child maintenance</h1>

<p>There are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable will depend on the arrangement you have and your circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Pay by standing order</h2>
<p>If you&#146;ve agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent directly
    from one person&#146;s bank or building society account to another person&#146;s account.</p>

<p>A standing order helps both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Use a money transfer service</h3>
<p>Another option is to use a money transfer service, like PayPal or MoneyGram. This method means you donâ€™t have to share your
    bank details with the other parent.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
    <p>Some of these services may charge a fee. Check with the service provider to make sure you understand if any charges will
        apply.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Other ways to pay</h4>

<p>If you make your own arrangement, you can agree to change your payment method if your circumstances change.</p>
<p>For example, if the paying parent loses their job, both parents could agree to reduce the child maintenance payments until
    the paying parent is back in work.</p>

<p>Or, if the receiving parent needs to make urgent repairs to the home they live in with the children, the paying parent could
    help with the cost by paying a lump sum, instead of the regular payments.</p>
