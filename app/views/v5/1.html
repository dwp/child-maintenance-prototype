        <p>You can arrange payments yourselves, if you can agree. This is called a &#146;family-based arrangement&#8217;.</p>
        <p>You agree how much the financial contributions should be and when they should be made.</p>

        <p>No one else is involved, and it can be flexible to your circumstances.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using the Child Maintenance Service</h2>
        <p>If you and your ex-partner can’t agree payments between you, you can contact the Child Maintenance Service (CMS).
            </p>

        <p>It will work out how much child maintenance should be paid and it can arrange for the money to be paid, if you want
            it to. There is a £20 fee for using the CMS, unless you are under 19, a victim of domestic abuse or in Northern
            Ireland.</p>

                            The £20 fee does not guarantee an arrangement for child maintenance payments.
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Other fees</h3>
        <p>If the paying parent is unlikely to pay or has failed to pay, a 'Collect and Pay' arrangement will be made. 
            This means you must pay:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a 20% fee on top of your regular child maintenance payment, if you're the paying parent</li>
            <li>a 4% fee deducted from your regular child maintenance payment, if you're the receiving parent</li>
        </ul>
