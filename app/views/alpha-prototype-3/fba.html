            Arranging child maintenence yourself
        </h1>
        <p>You can arrange child maintenance between yourselves, if you can agree. This is called a &#146;family-based arrangement&#8217;.</p>
        <p>There are no charges for making a family-based arrangement. Parents arrange everything themselves and no-one else
            has to be involved. It is flexible, and can be changed if either of your circumstances change.</p>
        <p>You agree how much the financial contributions should be and when they should be made.</p>
        <p>For example, you could both agree that the parent who does not have main day-to-day care of the child will pay:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a proportion of their income directly to the other parent</li>
            <li>for things like school clothes, trips or clubs</li>
            <li>a regular set amount directly to the other parent</li>
            <li>a larger lump sum at different stages in the child&#8217;s life</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you agree and want a formal arrangement</h2>
        <p>There is no official paperwork for a family-based arrangement, and they are not legally binding, but you can write
            down your agreement in case of future disagreement.</p>
        <p>You can ask a court to formalise your agreement using a consent order (in England and Wales), or a minute of agreement
            (in Scotland). These can be enforced through the courts if either parent does not do what has been agreed.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Working out payments</h2>
        <p>If you both agree to regular payments, you can <a href="calculator">get an estimate of how much payments should be</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
            If you cannot agree
        </h3>
        <p>The Child Maintenance Service is for when you and the other parent cannot agree a child maintenance arrangement between yourselves,
            or when a family-based arrangement can no longer work.</p>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            You can apply to the Child Maintenance Service for a statutory child maintenance arrangement if the consent order or minute
            of agreement was set up more than 12 months ago.
        
        </div>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Eligibility</h4>

            <li>a child over 12 living in Scotland</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="govuk-heading-m">Fees</h5>
