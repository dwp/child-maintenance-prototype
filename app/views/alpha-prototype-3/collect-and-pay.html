<p>Collect and Pay is for when the paying parent is unlikely to pay or has failed to pay.</p>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service works out the payment amount, then arranges to collect and pass on payments. They will arrange
    this around when the paying parent is paid their wages, pension or benefits.</p>

<p>There is a fee of Â£20 to apply for Collect and Pay.</p>

<p>You must also pay a fee each time you make or receive a payment:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>paying parents will pay a 20% fee on top of their regular child maintenance payment</li>
    <li>receiving parents will have a 4% fee deducted from their regular child maintenance payment</li>
</ul>

{% from "inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %} {{ govukInsetText({ text: "You cannot avoid collection fees by making
payments in advance." }) }}
<p>You will not have to pay any fees if you choose a
    <a href="">family-based arrangement.</a>
