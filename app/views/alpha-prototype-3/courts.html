        <p>You can arrange child maintenance using a consent order (in England and Wales), or a minute of agreement (in Scotland).
            This makes the arrangement legally binding. It can be enforced through the courts if either parent does not do
            what has been agreed.
        </p>
        <p>You cannot apply to the Child Maintenance Service for a statutory child maintenance arrangement within 12 months
            of setting up a consent order or a minute of agreement. If you have a consent order or minute of agreement made
            before April 2003, you cannot set up a statutory arrangement.
        </p>
