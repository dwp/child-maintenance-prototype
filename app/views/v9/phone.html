        <p>You will have to pay an application fee of £20, unless you are:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>under 19</li>
            <li>a victim of domestic abuse</li>
            <li>living in Northern Ireland</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The fee does not guarantee child maintenance payments will be made.</p>
