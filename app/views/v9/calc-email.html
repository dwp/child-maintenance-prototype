                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps</h2>

                <p>You now need to agree with the other parent how you will share the costs of raising your child.</p>
                <p>If you make your own arrangement you could agree to:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>regular payments of the calculated amount</li>
                    <li>regular payments of a different amount</li>
                    <li>payments in kind for things like uniforms, haircuts and activities</li>
                    <li>share care</li>
                    <li>a combination of contributions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You could also agree to review your arrangement every year, when children reach milestones like birthdays
                    or a change in schools, or if the income of either parent changes significantly.
                </p>

                <p>Some parents find it useful to
                    <a href="https://www.cmoptions.org/en/toolbox/maintenance-form.asp" target="_blank">write down their arrangement (opens in new window or tab) </a> so they have something to refer back to.
                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How and when to make payments
                </h2>
                <p>If you agree to a financial arrangement there are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable
                    will depend on your circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>If you have agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent
                    directly from one person’s bank or building society account to another person’s account.
                </p>

                <p>A standing order can help both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.
                </p>


                <p>If you have agreed to more flexible payments, these could be made by bank transfer, cheque, or pre-paid credit
                    card.
                </p>

                <p>If you cannot make an arrangement, or your arrangement stops working, you can:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
