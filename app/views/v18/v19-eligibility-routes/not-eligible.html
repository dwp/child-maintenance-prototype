                <p>The Child Maintenance Service can only enforce child maintenance arrangements where both parents and the children live in the UK.</p>

                <p>If one of the parents lives abroad, you may need a court order for maintenance, and to apply for it to be enforced in the other country.</p>

                <p>The UK has international agreements with more than 100 countries for child maintenance.
                      These arrangements are called Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO).</p>

                <p>If a REMO is in place, it means that:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>if a receiving parent and child live abroad, they can apply for a
                            foreign child maintenance order which will be enforceable against the paying parent who lives in the UK</li>

                      <li> if the receiving parent and child live in the UK, they can seek an order to register and enforce the
                        recovery of a child maintenance order from the paying parent who lives abroad</li>
                </ul>
