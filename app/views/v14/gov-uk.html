    <p>Both parents are legally responsible for the financial costs of raising their children, even if they don’t see them.</p>
    <p>Child maintenance is financial support to help pay for your child's everyday living costs when you are separated from
      the other parent.</p>

    <p>Studies show that children get the best outcomes when their separated parents are able to work together – this includes
      working together to arrange child maintenance.</p>
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">How you arrange child maintenance will depend on your circumstances. You can make an arrangement between yourselves,
      or you may be able to ask the Child Maintenance Service to make an arrangement for you.</div>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this service</h2>
    <p>This service gives information about your options for arranging child maintenance, and tools to help you make an arrangement.
