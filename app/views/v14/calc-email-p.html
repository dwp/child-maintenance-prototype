                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps</h2>

                <p>You can now agree how you will share the costs of raising your children. Use this calculation as a starting
                    point.
                </p>
                <p>Your arrangement can include whatever works for both parents.</p>

                <p>For example you could agree to:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>share care of the children</li>
                    <li>split the cost of specific items</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Or you could agree that one parent will pay:
                    </p>
                                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                    <li>some of their income to the parent the children live with</li>
                    <li>for things like housing costs, uniform, clothes, school trips or after school clubs</li>

                </ul>

                <p>No one else is involved, and the arrangement can be flexible to your circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>Some parents find it useful to
                    <a href="https://www.cmoptions.org/en/toolbox/maintenance-form.asp" target="_blank">write down their arrangement (opens in a new window or tab)</a> so they have something to refer back
                    to.
                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How and when to make payments
                </h2>
                <p>If you agree to a financial arrangement there are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable
                    will depend on your circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>If you have agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent
                    directly from one person’s bank or building society account to another person’s account.
                </p>

                <p>A standing order can help both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.
                </p>


                <p>If you have agreed to more flexible payments, these could be made by bank transfer, cheque, or pre-paid credit
                    card.
                </p>
