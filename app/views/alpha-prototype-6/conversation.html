<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Starting the conversation</h1>

<p>Talking about arrangements for children can be difficult. When preparing for your discussion about child maintenance, there
are four main things to think about:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>what you want to talk about</li>
    <li>how you will put your ideas forward</li>
    <li>when and where you will talk</li>
    <li>if you would like someone else to be there</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What do you want to talk about?</h2>
<p>Decide which things you feel are most important to sort out and think about what your ideal result would be for each thing.</p>
<p>Then think about which things you are prepared to compromise on.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How will you put your ideas forward?</h3>
<p>Think about the best way to explain your ideas to the other parent. You could write them down in a letter or email, or talk
about them face to face, or over the phone.</p>

<p>Start with the things that you think will be easiest to agree on, even if they're not your top priority. This can help you
to reach common ground, and make later decisions easier.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">When and where do you want to talk?</h4>
<p>Some people prefer to talk somewhere private, like their home. If you feel uncomfortable going to the other parent's home
or having them in your home, you could ask a friend or relative to let you use their home instead.</p>

<p>You could also meet the other parent somewhere more public and "neutral", like a cafe or a park.</p>

<p>Try to find a convenient time when you are both able to concentrate on the conversation, without other distractions or time
pressure.</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-m">Would you like someone else to be there?</h5>
<p>If you don’t feel comfortable speaking to your child’s other parent alone, you could ask a friend or relative that both parents
trust to be there during your conversation.</p>
<p>You could also ask a professional family mediator to help you agree an arrangement.</p>
