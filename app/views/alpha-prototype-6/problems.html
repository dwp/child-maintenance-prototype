<p>Private arrangements are not legally enforceable, and you will need to work together to make sure your arrangement keeps
working. </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How changes in your circumstances could affect child maintenance
</h2>

<p>Personal circumstances can change over time and you may want to plan for possible changes when you're arranging child maintenance.
</p>

<p>Changes that could affect your child maintenance arrangement include:
</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the income of the paying parent</li>
        <li>how many children you or the other parent have or support</li>
        <li>how many nights a week the child spends with each parent</li>
    </ul>
<p>With a private arrangement, you can agree to make changes if either parentâ€™s circumstances change, and you both agree to
the changes.
</p>
