<p>Child maintenance is financial support to help pay for your child's everyday living costs when you are 
  separated from the other parent.</p>

<p>Both parents are legally responsible for the financial costs of raising their children, even if they donâ€™t see them.</p>
<p>A child maintenance arrangement can help to give your child the best start in life, and can help you to work together
   as parents.</p>
<p>How you arrange child maintenance will depend on your circumstances.</p> <p>You can make an arrangement yourselves with no-one else involved.
   There are tools and information available to help.</p>
