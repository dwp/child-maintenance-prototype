<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How to make an arrangement</h1>
<p>There are many ways to arrange child maintenance between yourselves.</p>
<p>For example, you could agree to share care, split the costs of specific items, or that the non-resident parent
     will pay:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a proportion of their income to the parent with care</li>
        <li>for things like housing costs, uniforms, clothes, school trips, or after school clubs</li>
        <li>larger lump sums at certain times in the child’s life</li>
    </ul>

   <p>You can <a href="fba-case-study" target="_blank">view how others have made an arrangement themselves</a></p>

   <p>If you choose to make a financial arrangement, both parents will need to agree:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how much financial contributions will be</li>
        <li>when they will be paid</li>
        <li>how payments will be made</li>
    </ul>
<p>You could also agree to review or change your arrangement in the future.</p>

<p>If you need someone to help you to reach an agreement, ask a friend of family member, or 
    <a href="https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/">find a local mediator</a> to support you.</p>

    <p>Many separated parents write down what they have agreed to, so they have something to refer to.</p>

    <p>If you want to make your agreement legally binding, you can ask a court to formalise it with a
         consent order or minute of agreement. This means the agreement can be enforced through the courts
          if either parent doesn’t do what has been agreed.</p>
