   <p>If you choose to make a financial arrangement, both parents will need to agree:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how much financial contributions will be</li>
        <li>when they will be paid</li>
        <li>how payments will be made</li>
    </ul>
<p>You could also agree to review or change your arrangement in the future.</p>

</p>


<p>If you need someone to help you to reach an agreement, ask a friend or family member, or 
    <a href="https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/"target="_blank">find a local mediator (opens in new window or tab) </a> to support you.</p>

    <p>Many separated parents write down what they have agreed to, so they have something to refer to.</p>

    <p>If you want to make your agreement legally binding, you can ask a court to formalise it with a
         consent order or minute of agreement. This means the agreement can be enforced through the courts
          if either parent doesnâ€™t do what has been agreed.</p>
