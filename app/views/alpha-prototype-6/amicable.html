<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">You can make an arrangement yourself</h1>

<p>There are many ways to arrange child maintenance between yourselves.</p>
<p>For example, you could agree to share care, split the costs of specific items, or that the non-resident parent will pay:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a proportion of their income to the parent with care</li>
    <li>for things like housing costs, uniforms, clothes, school trips, or after school clubs</li>
    <li>larger lump sums at certain times in the child’s life</li>
</ul>

<p>You can

</p>

<p>If you choose to make a financial arrangement, both parents will need to agree:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>how much financial contributions will be</li>
    <li>when they will be paid</li>
    <li>how payments will be made</li>
</ul>
<p>You could also agree to review or change your arrangement in the future.</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-m">Would you like someone else to be there?</h5>
<p>If you don’t feel comfortable speaking to your child’s other parent alone, you could ask a friend or relative that both parents
    trust to be there during your conversation.</p>
<p>You could also ask a professional family mediator to help you agree an arrangement.</p>

<h6 class="govuk-heading-m">Calculating an amount </h6>
<p>You can use the
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-child-maintenance" target="_blank">
        Child Maintenance Calculator</a> If you are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>unsure of what is a fair amount to pay</li>
    <li>struggling to agree an amount</li>
    <li>in need of a starting point to agree an arrangement</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to make payments</h2>

<p>There are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable will depend on the arrangement you have and your circumstances.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Pay by standing order</h3>
<p>If you’ve agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent directly from
    one person’s bank or building society account to another person’s account.</p>

<p>A standing order helps both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Use a money transfer service</h4>
<p>Another option is to use a money transfer service, like PayPal or MoneyGram. This method means you don’t have to share yourbank
    details with the other parent.</p>
<p>
    <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Important</span> - some of these services may charge a fee. Check with the service provider to make sure you understand
    if any charges will apply.</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-m">Change your payment method if your circumstances change</h5>

<p>If you make your own arrangement, you can agree to change your payment method if your circumstances change.</p>

<p>For example, if the paying parent loses their job, both parents could agree to reduce the child maintenance payments until
    the paying parent is back in work.</p>

<p>Or, if the receiving parent needs to make urgent repairs to the home they live in with the children, the paying parent couldhelp
    with the cost by paying a lump sum, instead of the regular payments.</p>

    <h6 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if problems arise</h6>
    <p>Private arrangements are not legally enforceable, and you will need to work together to make sure your arrangement keeps
        working. A mediator can help you to get things back on track if your arrangement stops working effectively.
