<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Arranging payments yourself</h2>
<p>You can arrange payments yourselves, if you can agree. This is called a &#146;family-based arrangement&#8217;.</p>
<p>You agree how much the financial contributions should be and when they should be made.</p>
<p>If you both agree to regular payments, you can
    <a href="calculator">get an estimate of how much payments should be</a>.</p>


<p>You can ask a court to formalise your agreement using a consent order (in England and Wales), or a minute of agreement (in
    Scotland). These can be enforced through the courts if either parent does not do what has been agreed.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using the Child Maintenance Service</h2>
<p>If you and your ex-partner can’t agree child maintenance payments between you, you can contact the Child Maintenance Service
(CMS). </p> 

<p>It will work out how much child maintenance should be paid and it can arrange for the money to be paid, if you want
it to. There is a £20 fee for using the CMS, unless you are under 19, a victim of domestic abuse or in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p> There are 2 types of arrangement you can apply to make through the Child Maintenance Service:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Direct Pay</li>
                <li>Collect and Pay</li>
            </ul>
<p>Direct Pay is for when parents cannot agree, or have tried a family-based arrangement and it has stopped working.</p>
<p>Collect and Pay is for when the paying parent is unlikely to pay or has failed to pay.</p>

<p>For Collect and Pay you must also pay a fee each time you make or receive a payment:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>paying parents will pay a 20% fee on top of their regular child maintenance payment</li>
    <li>receiving parents will have a 4% fee deducted from their regular child maintenance payment</li>
</ul>
