        <p>You can arrange child maintenance between yourselves, if you can agree. This is called a &#146;family-based arrangement&#8217;.</p>
        <p>You agree how much the financial contributions should be and when they should be made.</p>

        <p>You can ask a court to formalise your agreement using a consent order (in England and Wales), or a minute of agreement
            (in Scotland). These can be enforced through the courts if either parent does not do what has been agreed.</p>
        <p>If you both agree to regular payments, you can
            <a href="calculator">get an estimate of how much payments should be</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using the Child Maintenance Service</h2>
        <p>If you and your ex-partner can’t agree child maintenance payments between you, you can contact the Child Maintenance
            Service (CMS). </p>

        <p>It will work out how much child maintenance should be paid and it can arrange for the money to be paid, if you want
            it to. There is a £20 fee for using the CMS, unless you are under 19, a victim of domestic abuse or in Northern
            Ireland.</p>

        <p> There are 2 types of arrangement you can apply to make through the Child Maintenance Service:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Direct Pay</li>
            <li>Collect and Pay</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Direct Pay is for when parents cannot agree, or have tried a family-based arrangement and it has stopped working.</p>
        <p>Collect and Pay is for when the paying parent is unlikely to pay or has failed to pay.</p>

        <p>For Collect and Pay you must also pay a fee each time you make or receive a payment:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>paying parents will pay a 20% fee on top of their regular child maintenance payment</li>
            <li>receiving parents will have a 4% fee deducted from their regular child maintenance payment</li>
        </ul>
