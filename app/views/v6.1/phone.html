        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Get help making or receiving child maintenance payments</h1>

        <p>If you cannot agree payments yourselves, you can contact the Child Maintenance Service for help.
            </p>

        <p>You will have to pay an application fee of £20, unless you are:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>under 19</li>
                <li>a victim of domestic abuse</li>
                <li>living in Northern Ireland</li>
                </ul>

                     <p> The fee does not guarantee child maintenance payments will be made.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Direct Pay</h2>

        <p>The Child Maintenance Service can work out how much child maintenance should be paid and help you to set up a payment arrangement
        between yourselves. This is called a ‘Direct Pay’ arrangement. The Child Maintenance Service will recalculate the payment
        amount if your circumstances change.
</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Collect and Pay</h2>
<p>If a Direct Pay arrangement does not work, the Child Maintenance Service may be able to collect the amount from the paying
parent and pass it to the receiving parent – this is known as a 'Collect and Pay' arrangement. If this happens, you'll need
to pay:
</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>a 20% fee on top of your regular child maintenance payment if you're the paying parent</li>
<li>a 4% fee taken off your regular child maintenance payment if you're the receiving parent.
</li>
</ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you apply to the Child Maintenance Service</h2>

        <p>Before you can apply to the Child Maintenance Service you need to speak to Child Maintenance Options. They’ll talk with you about arrangement options. If you decide to use the Child Maintenance Service, they’ll give you a reference
        number and explain how to apply.

            </p>

<li>details about the child you are applying for - including the full names of both their parents</li>
