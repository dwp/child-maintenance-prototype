        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How the Child Maintenance Service can help</h1>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service is for when you and the other parent cannot agree to a child maintenance arrangement.</p>

<p>Arrangements made through the Child Maintenance Service are not flexible, and cannot be adjusted to cover other costs or
include payments in kind. <a href="calculator">Use the online calculator</a> to find out how much the Child Maintenance Service is likely to calculate
for you.
</p>
<p>You will have to pay a one off application fee of £20, unless you are:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>under 19</li>
    <li>a victim of domestic abuse</li>
    <li>living in Northern Ireland</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Payment of the fee does not guarantee child maintenance payments will be made.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Direct Pay
</h2>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service can work out how much child maintenance should be paid and help you to set up a payment arrangement
between yourselves. This is called a ‘Direct Pay’ arrangement. The Child Maintenance Service may recalculate the payment
amount if your circumstances change.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Collect and Pay
</h3>
<p>If a Direct Pay arrangement does not work, the Child Maintenance Service may be able to collect the amount
     from the paying parent and pass it to the receiving parent – this is known as a 'Collect and Pay' arrangement.
      If this happens, you'll need to pay:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>a 20% fee on top of your regular child maintenance payment if you're the paying parent</li>
<li>a 4% fee taken off your regular child maintenance payment if you're the receiving parent.</li>
</ul>


<h5 class="govuk-heading-m">If you apply to the Child Maintenance Service</h5>
<p>You can apply if you’re:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the parent the child lives with</li>
<li>the parent the child does not live with</li>
<li>a grandparent or other guardian of the child</li>
<li>a child over 12 living in Scotland</li>

</ul>

<p> You will need to give information about you and your family, for example:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>details about the child you are applying for - including the full names of both their parents</li>
<li>your National Insurance number</li>
<li>your bank account details, if the Child Maintenance Service needs to collect and pass on payments</li>
</ul>
