                     This is what the Child Maintenance Service would expect you to pay if you had a statutory arrangement.</p>

                     <p>It is:
</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>based on the information you provided</li>
                                    <li>not a guarantee that payments will be made</li>

            </button>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps</h2>

                <p>You now need to agree with the other parent how you will share the costs of raising your child.</p>
                <p>If you make your own arrangement you could agree to:</p>
                                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                    <li>regular payments of the calculated amount</li>
                                    <li>regular payments of a different amount</li>
                                    <li>payments in kind for things like uniforms, haircuts and activities</li>
                                    <li>share care</li>
                                    <li>a combination of contributions</li>
                                </ul>

<p>You could also to review your arrangement every year, when children reach milestones like birthdays or a change in schools,
or if the income of either parent changes significantly.
</p>

<p>Some parents find it useful to <a href="https://www.cmoptions.org/en/toolbox/maintenance-form.asp">write down their arrangement</a> so they have something to refer back to.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How and when to make payments
</h2>
<p>If you agree to a financial arrangement there are several ways to pay child maintenance. The most suitable will depend on
your circumstances.
</p>

<p>If you have agreed on fixed regular payments, you could set up a standing order. This is where money is sent directly from
one person’s bank or building society account to another person’s account.
</p>

<p>A standing order can help both parents to plan and manage their finances, and keep a record of payments made.
</p>


<p>If you have agreed to more flexible payments, these could be made by bank transfer, cheque, or pre-paid credit card.
</p>


<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need help making an arrangement
</h4>

<p>If you cannot make an arrangement, or your arrangement stops working, you can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>ask a <a href="https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/" target="_blank">
  professional family mediator (opens in a new window or tab)</a>, friend or family member to help you</li>
  <li>speak to <a href="options-help">Child Maintenance Options</a> for support or more information</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If both parents still cannot agree, or something else is stopping you making your own arrangement, <a href="cms">the Child Maintenance
Service</a> may be able to help you.</p>
