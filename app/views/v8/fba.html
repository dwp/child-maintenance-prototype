        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Calculate child maintenance</h1>
<p>Use this calculator to work out child maintenance for your circumstances.
</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">The receiving parent has main day-to-day care of the child. The paying parent does not have main day-to-day care.
</div>


<p>The calculator uses the same rules as the Child Maintenance Service.
</p>
<p>You'll need to know:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>whether the paying parent gets any government benefits or State Pension</li>
          <li>the paying parent's total income before tax and National Insurance, but after pension contributions</li>
            <li>if any other children live with the paying parent</li>
        </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If there is more than one child maintenance arrangement</h2>
        <p>You should get a calculation for the total number of children and then divide it equally between them.</p>
