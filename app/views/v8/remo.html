        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">You are not eligible to apply for the Child Maintenance Service</h1>



<p>The Child Maintenance Service can only help in certain circumstances if one parent lives abroad, 
for example if the paying parent lives abroad and:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>is a civil servant</li>
<li>works in Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service</li>
<li>is a member of the Armed Forces</li>
<li>works for a company that is based and registered in the UK</li>
<li>is working on secondment for a ‘prescribed body’, like a regional health authority or local authority</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders</h2>

<p>The UK has international agreements with more than 100 countries for child maintenance. 
    These arrangements are called Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO).</p>
<p>If a REMO is in place, it means that:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">


<li>if a receiving parent and child live abroad, they can apply for a foreign child maintenance order which will be 
enforceable against the paying parent who lives in the UK</li>

<li>if the receiving parent and child live in the UK, they can seek an order to register and enforce the recovery of 
    a child maintenance order from the paying parent who lives abroad</li>

    </ul>
